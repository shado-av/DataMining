This folder contains raw and manipulated data describing the tasks of an airline dispatcher organized by dispatching shfit. 

'RLSinterarrivalTimes.csv' files contain the time between a release task for all of the dispatchers working during each shift. 

'FlightData.csv' files contain the total number of flights for each desk, as well as the number of short and long
haul flights out of this total, and the number of flights that departed during the shift (i.e. the number of flights
that the dispatcher must follow) out of the total number of flights. 

A summary of this data can be seen in the 'DistributionsbyShift.csv' files, which contains the summary distributions of 
the release interarrival times, the number of long haul flights, and the number of departed flights during each shift.
