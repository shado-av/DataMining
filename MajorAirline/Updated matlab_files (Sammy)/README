This folder includes matlab files used to mine data from a major airline company as well as 
calculate the best statistcal distributions of the data sets.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

AirlineDataMining.m 
- Matlab script which reads in an excel file and extracts the relevant times of the tasks performed. 
- In our case we extracted the Release, Arrival, and Departure times
- Outputs the interarrival times of each task organized by desk number
- Calculates the best distribution of the data file, using function DistributionFitter.m
- Outputs file of distribution best fit for each desk for each task, as well as the data historgrams


----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

DistributionFitter.m
- Matlab function which takes in a discrete (integer only) data set as an array, a task type string, and a desk number string
- Calculates the 4 distributions: uniform, triangular, exponential, and lognormal and the standard error of each
- Compares the standard error of each distribution and chooses best fit distribution based on the lowest error
- Outputs error, distribution, histogram figure, and valid (boolean)
- Valid will be 1 unless there are less than 5 data points, such that the distribution will be considered invalid (v=0)

Includes folders that contain both the data extracted from the original spreadsheet and the histograms plotted with the best fit model for each data set in the data folder.

Includes a .csv file that lists the best fit distributions for each task by desk number. 

To find summary distributions specific to shift time of day, see 'OrganizedByShift' folder.
