This folder includes matlab files used to mine data from a major airline company as well as 
calculate the best statistcal distributions of the data sets.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

AirlineDataMining.m 
- Matlab script which reads in an excel file and extracts the relevant times of the tasks performed. 
- In our case we extracted the Release, Arrival, and Departure times
- Outputs the interarrival times of each task organized by desk number
- Calculates the best distribution of the data file, using function DistributionFitter.m
- Outputs file of distribution best fit for each desk for each task, as well as the data historgrams


----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

DistributionFitter.m
- Matlab function which takes in a discrete (integer only) data set as a vector, a task type string, and a desk number string
- Calculates the 4 distributions: uniform, triangular, exponential, and lognormal and the standard error of each
- Compares the standard error of each distribution and chooses best fit distribution based on the lowest error
- Outputs error, distribution, histogram figure, and valid (boolean)
- Valid will be 1 unless there are less than 5 data points, such that the distribution will be considered invalid (v=0)
- parameters returned for each distribution:
triangular (min, mode, max)
uniform (min, max)
lognormal (log mean, log standard deviation)    *NOTE: can be transformed to mean and variance using lognstat function
exponental (mean)

Includes folders that contain both the data extracted from the original spreadsheet and the histograms plotted with the best fit model for each data set in the data folder.

Includes a .csv file that lists the best fit distributions for each task by desk number. 

To find summary distributions specific to shift time of day, see 'OrganizedByShift' folder.
